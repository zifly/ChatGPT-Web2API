"""Shared pytest configuration and fixtures.

Opt-in E2E tests
----------------
End-to-end tests that drive a *real* ChatGPT account via Chrome CDP are
marked with ``@pytest.mark.e2e``. They mutate the account and need a
logged-in browser, so they must NEVER run in normal/CI test runs.

The mechanism:
  - When ``W2A_E2E_RUN`` is unset (the default), e2e-marked items are
    *deselected* (silently dropped from the session) — not failed — so a
    bare ``pytest`` stays green with no account present.
  - When ``W2A_E2E_RUN=1``, they are collected and run.

The marker is also registered in ``pyproject.toml`` so pytest doesn't warn
about unknown markers, and CI runs ``pytest -m "not e2e"`` as a belt.
