"""Tests: send acknowledgment + diagnostic preservation.

ChatGPT code review (conv 6a52f0f3) found two defects:

1. click_send dispatches events but doesn't verify React accepted the
   submission. If the page is overloaded, the click fires but no message
   is sent. The bridge silently enters completion detection which finds
   nothing → reconciliation failure with no diagnostic.

2. TurnReconciliationError discards the underlying fetch_failed diagnostic.
   The actual error (CDP timeout, destroyed context, HTTP error) is lost.

Fix 1: after click_send + UUID wait, verify at least one acknowledgment:
  - UUID captured, OR
  - user-message DOM count increased AND composer cleared
  If none → raise SendNotAcknowledgedError before entering completion detection.

Fix 2: include last_result.diagnostic in TurnReconciliationError.
