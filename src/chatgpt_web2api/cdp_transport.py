"""CDP transport — Chrome DevTools Protocol wire primitives.

Phase 5 PR2 extraction (no behavior change). Owns the active page-websocket
wire layer that was previously inlined in ``CDPDriver``:

  - ``_reader_loop`` — background reader; sole consumer of ``_ws.recv()``,
    routes each CDP response to its id-keyed pending Future.
  - ``_cdp`` — send a CDP command + await its response via the future table;
    auto-reconnects once through ``driver.reconnect()`` on socket death.
  - ``_should_reconnect`` — pure error classifier for socket-death signatures.
  - ``_js`` / ``_js_strict`` — soft / strict ``Runtime.evaluate`` wrappers.
  - ``_js_with_data`` / ``_js_with_data_strict`` — safe ``__D`` data injection.

The driver-reference collaborator seam: ``CDPTransport`` holds a reference to
its owning ``CDPDriver`` and reaches through it for the live CDP socket and
the id-keyed response table. None of that state migrates into this module —
it stays on the driver so external attribute reads (connect/reconnect/close,
``is_connected``) and test stubs that poke ``driver._ws`` /
``driver._pending`` / ``driver._reader_task`` keep working unchanged.

Boundary (Layer 1 only): this module is the ACTIVE page-websocket wire layer.
Connection lifecycle, tab discovery (``connect``/``reconnect``/
``_find_*_ws``/``_create_owned_tab``/``_browser_cdp``), and ``close`` stay in
``cdp_driver.py`` (Layer 2). ``reconnect`` owns breaker semantics; this module
calls back into ``driver.reconnect()`` but never duplicates or moves breaker
handling.

Call-rule inside CDPTransport method bodies:

  transport state:         self._driver._ws
                           self._driver._msg_id
                           self._driver._pending
  layer-2 callback:        self._driver.reconnect()
  sibling wire helpers:    self._cdp(...)
                           self._js(...)
                           self._js_strict(...)

Internal wire-to-wire calls (``_js`` → ``_cdp``, ``_js_with_data`` → ``_js``)
go through ``self._driver`` (not ``self``) so driver monkeypatches of
``driver._cdp`` / ``driver._js`` keep intercepting — the same driver-facing
seam BackendClient relies on.

        Routes each incoming CDP message to the matching pending Future by id.
        Messages without an id (unsolicited CDP events like
        ``Network.requestWillBeSent``, ``Page.frameNavigated``) are dispatched
        to a registered event handler if one exists for the event's method
        name (via ``driver._cdp_event_handlers``); otherwise they are logged
        at DEBUG and discarded.

        all pending CDP command futures — blocking it on heavy work (e.g.
        parsing a large POST body synchronously) risks unrelated CDP
        timeouts. Handlers that need to do expensive work should schedule it
        via ``loop.create_task`` and return immediately. If a handler raises,
        it is logged and swallowed so one bad handler cannot kill the reader.
