"""ChatGPT DOM interaction — composer/send-button/rate-limit DOM helpers.

Phase 5 PR3 extraction (no behavior change). Owns the ChatGPT-composer
interaction surface that was previously inlined in ``CDPDriver``:

  - composer selectors (``COMPOSER_SELECTOR`` etc.)
  - composer presence / send-readiness (``_has_composer``,
    ``_wait_for_composer``, ``_ensure_send_ready``)
  - message typing / verification (``type_message``,
    ``_detect_select_all_modifier``, ``_verify_composer_text``)
  - send button click (``click_send``)
  - rate-limit popup dismissal (``dismiss_rate_limit``)
  - selector-drift diagnostics (``_capture_selector_diagnostic``)

The driver-reference collaborator seam: ``ChatGPTDom`` holds a reference to
its owning ``CDPDriver`` and reaches through it for the CDP transport
(``_js`` / ``_js_strict`` / ``_cdp``), for shared mutable state
(``_breakers``, ``_current_conv_id``), and for navigation peers
(``navigate_new_chat``). None of that state migrates into this module — it
stays on the driver so external attribute reads and test stubs keep working
unchanged.

Boundary: this module is the ChatGPT page DOM-interaction layer. Connection
lifecycle, navigation (``navigate_new_chat`` / ``navigate_conversation`` /
``navigate_gpt`` / ``select_model``), ``send_and_stream`` orchestration, and
conversation-id ownership stay in ``cdp_driver.py``.

Breaker rule: three methods record ``BreakerKind.COMPOSER_SEND_READINESS``
failures/successes. The breaker registry STAYS on the driver; this module
only calls ``record_failure`` / ``record_success`` through
``self._driver._breakers``. No breaker-policy code moves.

Call-rule inside ChatGPTDom method bodies — every internal call routes
through ``self._driver`` (NOT ``self``) to preserve monkeypatch interception
on the driver-facing seam (the PR2 lesson):

  transport:        self._driver._js(...)
                    self._driver._js_strict(...)
                    self._driver._cdp(...)

# ChatGPT composer selectors (post-2026 composer redesign).
#
# The old composer was a real <textarea id="prompt-textarea">. The new
# composer is a contenteditable ProseMirror div; the element that still
# carries id="prompt-textarea" is a HIDDEN fallback (<textarea
# class="wcDTda_fallbackTextarea">) that overlays the real composer when
# JS is off. Typing into it does not reach the composer, so the message
# never lands — every send then fails with "no send button" because the
# composer is empty. These selectors target the real, interactive nodes.
#
# COMPOSER_SELECTOR is the primary target; the #prompt-textarea fallback
# is kept as a last-resort so the driver still works if ChatGPT rolls
# the composer back (or on an A/B holdout that hasn't shipped the new
# UI). Both are tried in preference order by the helpers below.
COMPOSER_SELECTOR = 'div[role="textbox"]#prompt-textarea, div[role="textbox"].ProseMirror'
COMPOSER_FALLBACK_SELECTOR = "textarea#prompt-textarea"

# The send button. The new composer has no data-testid="send-button" —
# its affordances are composer-plus-btn and dictation, plus a
# stop-button while generating. The send affordance is the submit
# <button> inside the composer form whose aria-label is "send" (and
# which is not the stop button). We match by aria-label first, then by
# the legacy testid for older deployments.
SEND_BUTTON_SELECTOR = 'button[aria-label*="Send" i]:not([data-testid="stop-button"])'
SEND_BUTTON_FALLBACK_SELECTOR = 'button[data-testid="send-button"]'
# P2.5: broader fallback — a submit-type button inside the COMPOSER FORM
# (scoped to the form containing #prompt-textarea, not page-global, to avoid
# hitting login/search/feedback forms if the page is displaced). If ChatGPT
# changes the aria-label (selector drift), a submit-type button inside the
# composer form is still the send affordance. This is the LAST resort.
SEND_BUTTON_BROAD_SELECTOR = (
    'form:has(#prompt-textarea) button[type="submit"],'
    'form:has(.ProseMirror) button[type="submit"]'
)

# Send-button readiness poll. After a prior send completes (or under parallel
# mode, where the MutationLock releases the instant a send finishes), ChatGPT's
# composer can take several seconds to re-enable the send button — the composer
# stays in a "sending"/"regenerating" state with the button disabled or absent
# until the UI settles. The historical 3s budget (range(10) * 0.3s) was too
# tight for back-to-back same-tab sends and surfaced as intermittent
# "no send button" 500s. 10s covers observed reset times without hanging
# indefinitely on a genuinely broken composer.
